# empowerment

Reinforcement learning is a powerful tool for teaching agents complex skills based on experience. However, it relies upon a supervisor or "critic" to dole out rewards, defining a norm for "good" behaviour externally. In the biological world, such supervisors rarely exist, and creatures must learn about their environments independently and autonomously.

In the absence of specific rewards provided by external entities, autonomous agents should be self-motivated, and driven by behaving in such a way that makes them more prepared for future tasks or challenges. **Empowerment** has been proposed as an **intrinsic motivation** for autonomous behaviour [in this paper](https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/1918/901933.pdf?sequence=1) [1]. I've also written about empowerment [in this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/empowerment-as-intrinsic-motivation-b84af36d5616). 

Empowerment measures how much power an agent has to influence the state of its environment.
